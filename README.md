# motorteststand
Code for the model rocket test stand. 
The calibration code is for calibrating the load cell. To test it, upload the code and open the serial monitor. Follow the instructions from there. 
Once you have finsihed the calibration, the serial monitor should give you a Calibration value. Go ahead and copy that to the clipboard and enter 'y' into the serial monitor.
If the serial monitor reads NAN or wrong values, recheck your pin designations.
Once you the the right results, open the "Thrust Stand" Code. You can ignore the "Measuring" code.
Scroll through the code until you find a line of code that says //paste calval here.
Paste the Calibration value there and upload the code.
Take off the calibration weight and open the serial monitor. 
The test stand should work.
